# twitch menubar application 

## main goals 
- notify you when any of your followed channels on twitch go live
- show a neat little window of all the channels that you follow and who's live, so you don't have to open twitch
- super lightweight - no battery usage and limited background activity
- cool onboarding process (this might be tough)
