# twitch menubar application 

## main goals 
- notify you when any of your followed channels on twitch go live
- show a neat little window of all the channels that you follow and who's live, so you don't have to open twitch
- super lightweight - no battery usage and limited background activity
- cool onboarding process (this might be tough)

## disclaimer 
I know nothing about macOS application development and I don't know much Swift. It's a weird language to be honest. The documentation isn't great. Beyond using LLMs to figure out how to do stuff, there isn't much hope. I don't know how to make pretty UIs in Swift. Probably a skill issue.
There might be weird practices in here, sorry. But it works!

## roadmap 

It seems like I have to pay Apple $100 to do anything useful (like send notifications), so this app might not grow much from here. I just built this to see how fast I could ship a semi-decent working app.
